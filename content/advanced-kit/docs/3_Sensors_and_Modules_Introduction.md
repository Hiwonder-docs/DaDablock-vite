# 3. Sensors and Modules Introduction

## 3.1 360° Block Motor

### 3.1.1 Sensor Overview

This is a servo that works with a wide range of LEGO-compatible building blocks. It is typically controlled using PWM, or Pulse Width Modulation. Because it is a continuous-rotation servo, the PWM signal controls the rotation speed and direction, but not a specific rotation angle.

| Rated torque | 1 N.m |
| Rotation range | 0-360° |
| Cable length | 25 cm |
| Dimensions | 40 x 16 mm |

### 3.1.3 Wiring Diagram

Connect the motor to the controller port S1. Make sure the yellow wire is connected to S, the red wire to 5V, and the brown wire to GND, as shown below:

### 3.1.4 Test Demo

Once the program has been downloaded and is running, the block motor rotates forward at a speed of 50 for 2 seconds, then reverses at the same speed for 2 seconds, and finally stops.

- The program uses the block **Set servo ID S1 rotate at a speed of 50** because the block motor must be controlled with a PWM signal, and the controller outputs PWM through ports S1-S6. In this example, S1 is used to send the control signal to the block motor.

## 3.2 270° Block Servo

### 3.2.1 Sensor Overview

This is a servo that works with a wide range of LEGO-compatible building blocks. It is generally controlled using PWM, or Pulse Width Modulation. Unlike a continuous-rotation servo, this is a limited-rotation servo, which means it can control angle position within a restricted range of 0-270°.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_3/media/image2.png"  class="inline-icon" style="width:400px;" >

### 3.3.4 Test Demo

Once the program has been downloaded and is running, the button sensor state is tested through the onboard buzzer. When the button is not pressed, the buzzer remains silent. When the button is pressed, the buzzer sounds.

### 3.3.5 Program Screenshot

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_3/media/image3.png"  class="inline-icon" style="width:400px;" >

- The program uses the **wait 0.2 seconds** block because when a physical button is pressed or released, its metal contacts briefly bounce. This causes the signal level to switch back and forth repeatedly in a short time, so the program may interpret a single press as multiple presses. Waiting 0.2 seconds allows the button's mechanical bounce to settle, ensuring that the program detects one stable button-press signal and preventing the tone from being played repeatedly by mistake.
